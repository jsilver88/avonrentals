                <h4>Welcome</h4>
                <p>Supporting the Entertainment Industry for nearly 3 decades, Avon is proud to boast one of the largest
                    independently owned and operated fleet of vehicles in Southern California.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Avon is dedicated to keeping Hollywood in Hollywood by providing state of the art equipment and level
                    of service filmmakers are unable to find in any other city in the world. Customer service is
                    available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Round the clock access to our fleet and studio
                    transportation services is a necessary advancement to comply to our customers needs. Free pick up
                    and drop off is an option if staffing is short. Production storage has been made available by the
                    day, week and month. Give us a suggestion and we will make it a reality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The rhythm of the industry has changed. There was a time when you could set your clock to the seasons
                    of production. Television, Pilots, Features and Commercials all had their own schedules overlapping
                    and retreating but predictable. Now with digital cable and satellite television hundreds of channels
                    racing to fill time slots, studios shooting the next blockbuster and not forgetting the phenomenon
                    that is reality television, production in the 21st century has reinvented itself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Avon Studio Transportation has recognized the change in the climate and we have evolved in order to
                    provide a unique one on one service department that can focus on each customer individually when
                    requesting 1 vehicle or 75 vehicles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In a world where large corporations devour large corporations, it’s unusual to find a company large
                    enough to accommodate your needs yet caring enough to watch your back, hold your hand and give you a
                    leg up when needed. It’s refreshing to pick up a phone or walk in to an office time after time and
                    hear the same voices or see the same faces. It is comforting for any type of business to know that
                    the day to day and or crisis transactions will be handled by the same professional that has taken
                    care of them day in and day out. Let Avon Studio Transportation help you bring your productions in
                    on time and on budget.</p>
